Machbase Neo supports writing and query data via MQTT protocols. 

{: .note }
MQTT `v3.1.1` (or `v3.1`) is officially surpported. `v5` is early experimental state and does **not** recommended to use.

The real benefit of MQTT api over HTTP api is that it utilizes `append` feature of Machbase that provides robust performance of writing data.
Since MQTT is connection oriented protocol and keeping a session through a connection, clients can continuosly write data stream,
and also MQTT protocol is commonly supported by most of IoT devices.

So it is the best way to make the sensors to write its collecting data to Machbase Neo via MQTT.
