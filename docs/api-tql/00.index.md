# TQL API

Machbase Neo supports Transformative Query Language and execution API.

As application developers, we generally takes similar approch to build a data utilizing application.
This process is typically starting with quering database and retrieving data in a tabular form(rows and colums), converting it into desired data structure,
then manipulating and displaying the final result into desied shape such as JSON, CSV or chart.

TQL is simplifing those process int few lines of script. And its TQL API execute pre-defined script.


{: .warning }
> Currently TQL feature is in experimental stage. It requires `--experiment=true` option when machbase-neo starts up. `machbase-neo serve --experiment=true`

## Glance at TQL

1. Open machbase-neo web UI with your web browser, the default address is http://127.0.0.1:5654/, username 'sys' and password 'manager'.
2. Select "TQL" on the 'New Tab...' page.

3. Copy and paste the sample TQL codes into the TQL editor
    ```
    INPUT( FAKE( oscilator(freq(1.5, 1.0), range('now', '3s', '10ms')) ))
    OUTPUT(CHART_LINE())
    ```
4. Then click "play" icon on the top left of the editor, it will display line chart like below image.
    which is a wave that has 1.5 Hz frequency and 1.0 amplitude.

5. Change `OUTPUT(CHART_LINE())` to `OUTPUT(CSV())` and execute, it will show the result in CSV format.

This example takes data from "fake" data generator instead of "real" database stored data.
We will show how to get the real data from database and various way to display the result through this tutorials.
