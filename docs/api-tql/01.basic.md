## Primitive types

TQL has three types for primitive `string`, `number` and `boolean`.

- `string` : Define constant strings as like traditional programming languages with quation marks, single('), double (") and backtick(`).
The backtick'ed string is usuful when you need to define a string in multiple lines including quation marks inside such as long SQL statement.

    ```
    INPUT( SQL( 'select * from mytable where name=\'temperature\' limit 10' ))
    ```

    ```
    INPUT( SQL( `select * 
                 from mytable 
                 where name='temperature'
                 limit 10` ))
    ```

- `number` : TQL treats all numberic constants as 64bit floating number.

    ```
    INPUT( QUERY( from('mytable', 'temperature'), limit(10)))
    ```

    ```
    INPUT( FAKE( oscilator( freq(12.34, 20)) ))
    ```

- `boolean` : `true` and `false`

    ```
    OUTPUT( CSV( heading(false) ))
    ```

## Statements

Every expression in TQL should be a function call except the literal constants of string, number and boolean.

```
# A comment line starts with '#'

# Each statement should start from first column.
INPUT( 
    range('mytable', 'temperature'),
    limit(10)
)
OUTPUT(CSV)
```

## INPUT() and OUTPUT()

Every `.tql` script should start with `INPUT()` statement and end with `OUTPUT()`. And appears only once(), any redundant `INPUT()`, `OUTPUT()` occurs an error.

## MAP functions

There may come zoro or more map functions between `INPUT()` and `OUTPUT()`.
The names of all map functions are with capital letters, in contrast lower case named functions are used as arguments of the map functions.
