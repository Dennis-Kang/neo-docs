# How to start and stop Machbase Neo

## Start

### foreground

```sh
machbase-neo serve
```

![](30.start-stop/server-serve.gif)

### background

If pid file path is given, the process id of machbase-neo will be written on it.
It could be helpful later to stop the process running in background mode with `--daemon` option.

```sh
machbase-neo serve --daemon --pid ./machbase-neo.pid
```

## Stop

### foreground

If the server is running in foreground mode, simply press `Ctrl+C`.

###  background

If a pid file was generated, signal `SIGTERM` to process as like the command below.

```sh
kill `cat ./machbase-neo.pid`
```

Or use `shutdown` command. It works only if it is executed in the same host.

```sh
machbase-neo shell shutdown
```
