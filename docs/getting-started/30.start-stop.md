# How to start and stop Machbase Neo

## Start

```sh
machbase-neo serve
```

![](30.start-stop/server-serve.gif)

### background

If pid file path is specified, process id of machbase-neo will be written on it.
It could be helpful for stop it later

```sh
machbase-neo serve -d -pid ./machbase-neo.pid
```

## Stop

### foreground

If server is running in foreground mode, simply press `Ctrl+C`.

###  background

If pid file was generated, signal `SIGTERM` to process

```sh
kill `cat ./machbase-neo.pid`
```

Or use `shutdown` command. It works only within local host.

```sh
machbase-neo shell shutdown
```
